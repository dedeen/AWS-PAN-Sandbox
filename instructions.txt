Raw instructions to build entire platform: 
- in AWS CLI environment (cloudshell or the like), git clone this repo. 
-  cd into the shell subdir
-  run setup.sh to install terraform
[build the AWS networks]
- cd to the Terraform subdir
- terraform init, apply - wait until successful. Large build (~200 resources), so may have to rerun apply 
    - should now have 5 VPCs, ~35 subnets, ~20 route tables, 2 new S3 buckets with configs inside, etc.
